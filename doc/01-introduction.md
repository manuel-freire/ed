- office 325
- office hours 
    + tuesday 10-11h and 16-18h
    + *send an email first, with \[ED] in the subject*
    + mostly flexible regarding office hours dates, hours, and tech
- can request group office hours, either face to face or via meet

# Contacting me

- preferred channel: **e-mail**: \
    I really don't like looking up up messages in Moodle\
    **avoid Moodle for messaging**
- include **[ED]** in your subject

# Activities

- C1 - 2w - Abstract Data Structures
- C2 - 2w - Linear ADTs: vectors, lists, stacks, queues, ...
- C3 - 2w - Recursive ADTs: mostly binary trees, but there are *many*
- C4 - 2w - Associative ADTs: maps, sets, and the magic of hashing
- C5 - 5w - Combining ADTs to do usefull things

We have roughtly **13** course weeks, with **3** 1-hour sessions/week

# The sessions

- Tuesdays we will **exercise** (Lab 3)
- Wednesday & Friday, **theory** in Room 14
    + Theory is quite practical: **bring laptops** (if you can) to view / run / modify code examples
    + *Be there* or lose assistance points: random-ish Kahoot quizzes to measure assistance & gauge knowledge.

# Exercises

- Lab exercises: **individual programming**, automated judge, very strict inputs and outputs. Graded. **Similar to exam**
- Class exercises: **ad-hoc** groupings, mostly to find and compare different options. Sometimes-graded.

# Grading

- **30%** - lab exercises & other gradable activities. 
    + **Mostly labs**
        * ~12 labs over the course
        * 100% lab grade if it works according to statement within 1h
        * 70% grade if within same day
        * 50% grade if before answers are posted, or before exam, whichever comes first: no excuses not to solve those exercises.
    + Special, optional batch of exercises for Easter, which can boost this grade further (counts as up to 2 good labs; can overflow).
    + **Assistance** (measured via Kahoot) is part of this grade.
    + None of this 30% can be recovered for the 2nd round of final exams (convocatoria extraordinaria). **Do** turn in your exercises/come to class, or lose this grade forever.
- **70%** - final exam, must score at least 5/10 for exercises to weigh in, otherwise final exam grade is directly final grade.

# AI & plagiarism

- The main reason for exercises being worth so little is possible cheating, either from colleagues or AI chatbots.
- Your goal in doing the exercises should be to **learn**
    + the exam is basically lab exercises: to get a good grade, practice makes perfect.
    + Data Structures are must-know for programming, and you *will* need that knowledge in your professional life.
- *AI & plagiarism are useful tools, and can be used to learn*. Do not abuse them.
    + **do** ask machines and colleagues how they do things, to learn from them. **do** help colleagues understand your approaches: you will learn a lot from teaching (I do!).
    + do **not** rely too much on these tools, as they will be unavailable in the exam, and in many cases in real life.
- If I think that you have relied too heavily on either AI or collegues (verbatim copy + very minor changes), you will get a 0 on that lab exercise.
    + I am the author of a multi-language plagiarism-detection tool\footnote{See \url{https://github.com/manuel-freire/ac2} }, and have been maintaining it for over 20 years. *I really do not like cheating, and have studied this extensively*.

# Why is this important?

- These are the basic tools of the trade. If you code, or interact with people who do, this is what they really speak. **You cannot be a good programmer without knowing your data types!**
- Languages come and go (and evolve). But data structures change very, very slowly - and **all languages have ADTs in their standard libraries**. Which ones will you use?
- The last chapter ties directly with actual problems. Those problems are very similar to the contests set up by Big Five (and *many* other) tech firms. See links

# The exam

Exams always have 3 questions:

* One about lists, to check your knowledge of lists & pointers (Linear ADTs)
* One about tree-like structures, to see if you can code efficient recursion (Branching ADTs).
* One where you have to apply multiple ADTs to a real-ish problem, worth almost 50% of the grade (Associative & Combining ADTs)
