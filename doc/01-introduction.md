- office 325
- office hours 
    + tuesday 16-17h, & thursday 10-11h
    + *send an email first, with \[ED] in the subject*
    + mostly flexible regarding office hours dates, hours, and tech
- can request group office hours, either face to face or via meet

# Contacting me

- preferred channel: **e-mail**: \
    I really don't like looking up up messages in Moodle\
    **avoid Moodle for messaging**
- include **[ED]** in your subject

# The subject

- C1 - 2w - Abstract Data Structures
- C2 - 2w - Linear ADTs: vectors, lists, stacks, queues, ...
- C3 - 2w - Recursive ADTs: mostly binary trees, but there are *many*
- C4 - 2w - Associative ADTs: maps, sets, and the magic of hashing
- C5 - 5w - Combining ADTs to do usefull things

We have roughtly **13** course weeks, with **3** 1-hour sessions/week

# The sessions

- Tuesdays we will **exercise** (Lab 1)
- Wednesday & Friday, **theory** in Room 14, but **bring laptops** (if you can)

# Exercises

- Lab exercises: **pairwise programming**, automated judge, very strict inputs and outputs. Graded.
- Class exercises: **ad-hoc** groupings, mostly to find and compare different options. Sometimes-graded.

# Grading

- **30%** - lab exercises \footnote{or other gradable activities, but mostly labs}. And you **have** to be there, and cannot compensate lost grade here. 
- **70%** - final exam, must score at least 5/10 for exercises to weigh in, otherwise final exam grade is directly final grade.

# Why is this important?

- These are the basic tools of the trade. If you code, or interact with people who do, this is what they really speak. **You cannot be a good programmer without knowing your data types!**
- Languages come and go (and evolve). This changes very, very slowly - and **all languages will have ADTs in their standard libraries**.
- The last chapter ties directly with actual problems. Those problems are very similar to the contests set up by Big Five (and *many* other) tech firms. See links
